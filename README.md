# SpinDoctor Toolbox for blood flow imaging (based on developmental code, not documented)

Extended version for blood flow imaging using Streamline Upwind Petrov-Galerkin method + theta method, based on developed version

## Software requirements

The SpinDoctor Toolbox has been developed in the MATLAB R2020b and tested with MATLAB R2018a-R2021a.

SpinDoctor requires no additional MATLAB Toolboxes. However, if the MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox is available,
the simulations can be run in parallel.


## Getting started

1) The base folder contains a commented general purpose driver called `driver_spindoctor.m`. The other driver, `driver_save_load.m`, can save and load simulations.
2) The input files for the drivers are found in the folder `setups`, and define the structures needed for the simulations.
3) Multiple neuron meshes are found in the folder `mesh_files`. These can be loaded in the `setups/setup_neuron.m` script.
4) The user guide is found [here](https://github.com/jingrebeccali/SpinDoctor/blob/master/user_guide.pdf).
