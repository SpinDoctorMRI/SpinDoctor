# SpinDoctor Toolbox (developmental code, not documented)

SpinDoctor is a software package that performs numerical simulations of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) for prototyping purposes.

This is an extended version for simulating direction varying sequences for human microglia.

## Software requirements

The SpinDoctor Toolbox has been developed in the MATLAB R2020b and tested with MATLAB R2018a-R2021a.

SpinDoctor requires no additional MATLAB Toolboxes. However, if the MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox is available,
the simulations can be run in parallel.


## Getting started

1) The setup scripts in the setups folder can be used to modify the solver and types of gradient sequences.
2) To accommodate batch processing, an individual cell can be run using the driver_cell.m or driver_btpde.m functions.
    Here the user can specify the tetgen options used and length scales of the matrix formalism.
    An example of how to call these functions is given in example.m
3) driver_output_signals.m will save the signals into.mat files and also to plain text files.
4) driver_get_morez_errors.m and driver_get_pgse_errors.m compares the matrix formalism signals against the finite element ode15 solution.
5) The user guide is found [here](https://github.com/jingrebeccali/SpinDoctor/blob/master/user_guide.pdf).
