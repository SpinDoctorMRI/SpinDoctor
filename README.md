# SpinDoctor Toolbox Variable Gradient Directions (old code 2021)

==================================

This branch contains code dating from 2021 implementing variable gradient directions (not documented)

==================================

SpinDoctor is a software package that performs numerical simulations of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) for prototyping purposes.

## Software requirements

The SpinDoctor Toolbox has been developed in the MATLAB R2020b and tested with MATLAB R2018a-R2021a.

SpinDoctor requires no additional MATLAB Toolboxes. However, if the MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox is available,
the simulations can be run in parallel.
