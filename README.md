# Neuron Meshing paper

This code was used in a forthcoming publication by us to simulate diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) experiments on realistic neuron and microlgia geometries. The primary purpose of the code is to test our meshes against the meshes produced by the Ultraliser tool (available here https://github.com/BlueBrain/Ultraliser).

To test for an individual cell, run 
```
driver_demo;
```
The sequences, cell geometry and experimental parameters can be adjusted in the setup file.

The simulations for the neuron 1-2-2.CNG can be done by running:
```
driver_run_neuron_simulations;
```

The simulations for the human microglia cells can be done by running:
```
driver_run_microglia_simulations; 
```
and comparing the signals of individual compartments is done in:
```
compare_microlgia_segmented;
```

We note that if the tetgen parameters are changed then the correspondance between branches may be altered. If branches are split/merged then it is necessary to manually assign the correspondance between branches. This is done in the switch statements in compare_microglia_segmented and also in the last section of driver_run_neuron_simulations.

The figures for the paper were plotted using plot_data.ipynb.


# SpinDoctor Toolbox

SpinDoctor is a software package that performs numerical simulations of diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) for prototyping purposes. This branch contains the code and data used in a forthcoming publication describing our surface meshing algorithm https://github.com/AlexMcSD/mesh_swc.

## Software requirements

The SpinDoctor Toolbox has been developed in the MATLAB R2020b and tested with MATLAB R2018a-R2021a.

SpinDoctor requires no additional MATLAB Toolboxes. However, if the MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox is available,
the simulations can be run in parallel.


## Updates July 2024

New features:

* Simulation of general gradient sequences is now supported. These sequences can be read directly from a Camino .scheme file. Simulations can be run for solve_btpde, solve_btpde_midpoint, and solve_mf.
* Segmenting a finite element mesh into soma and processes/dendrites when the mesh comes from a swc file.
* Code refactoring, to incorporate the new features.



## Updates March 2021

All modules (master, T2, NeuronModule, MatrixFormalismModule) are now merged and found in the `master` branch. The previous versions of the modules are still found in their branches.

New features:

* Code refactoring, change of data structures
* New input file system, controlled by a structure `setup`
* Some speed and memory improvements (extensive vectorization, reduced memory usage in ODE solvers)
* Support for parallel outer loops (solve for multiple directions, amplitudes and sequences in parallel)
* Diffusion tensors as an alternative to scalar diffusion coefficients
* Matrix formalism with built in Matlab functions instead of PDE Toolbox
* Add convex hull ECS + tight wrap ECS for neurons (experimental feature)
* Simple interface for pulse sequences, the user can add custom sequences
	* by passing a function handle, for which the integral quantities are computed numerically,
	* or by manually defining a subclass of the `Sequence` class
